# Linear-Regression-Final-Project
Final Project for STAT5680 -Linear Regression-

This project was developed to understand if there was a difference between estimated performance and published performance of CPUs from top manufacturers in the 1980's.

Regression Analysis was used to determine the outcome of the above statement.

Statistical Measures:

	Scatterplots - used to see the plot points of ERP (estimated relative performance) and PRP (published relative performance).
	Residual vs. Fitted Values plots.
	Q-Q Plots of Residuals.
 	Hypothesis test - H0: There is no difference between ERP and PRP
			  HA: ERP and PRP are different
	Two seperate linear regression models - ERP and PRP using all predictive variables.
 	Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests - test what predictor variables to keep in the models.
	Linear Regression Assumptions - Linearity, Constant Variance, Independence, and Normal Distribution.
